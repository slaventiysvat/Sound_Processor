# Sound_Processor
Adaptive Noise Reduction using RLS algorithm, NLMS algorithm for Echo Cancelation, VAD of G729 to separate noise from voice
Now we can use only NLMS and RLS algorithms.
The main.c function contains in Sound_Processor_V1.1
You can check RLS algorithm use your own raw files
MATLAB folder contain MATALB files where I created my 
all algorithm for voice processing and noise reduction.

21.08.2024 Adde Eigen Library as submodule to my project, 
I hope my maths function will be faster and more convenient.
Also here i have Google Tests as submodule, it is cool
In general, i could use vcpkg or cmake but not for this moment
vcpkg or cmake will be in the next iteration after upgrading 
Sound_Processor_V1.1
