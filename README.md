# Sound_Processor
Adaptive Noise Reduction using RLS algorithm, NLMS algorithm for Echo Cancelation, VAD of G729 to separate noise from voice
Now we can use only NLMS and RLS algorithms.
The main.c function contains in ..\Visual_Studio\Sound_Processor_Half\RLS
You can check RLS algorithm use your own raw files
